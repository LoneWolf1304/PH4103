Compare Zeeman splitting and temperature something something..... k_BT

- Zeeman Splittling Due to magnetic field.
- Alternating Field to produce the steady state of electrons in upper and lower level.
- At resonance large no of electron in upper state and lower state, so easy to visualize.

-why metals not used in ESR?
